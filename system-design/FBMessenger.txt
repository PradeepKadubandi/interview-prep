Functional:
 - Send and receive text (one-to-one chat)
 - Group chat
 - Add / Remove friends / contacts
 - Create groups from contacts
 - online / offline status
 - storage of chat history
Non Functional:
 - Responsive and low latency chat (real time)
 - highly consistent (same chat on all devices)
 - highly available but can take hit for consistency

Capacity estimates:
  Total Messages = 20 billion / day
  Storage per day = 2 TB
  Storage for 5 years = 3.6 PB
  Incoming Data = Outgoing Data = 25 MB/s

Thoughts:
  - Storage is cold (only write, infrequent read)
  - Network bandwidth management and latency are biggest concerns

Workflow:
  - User A sends message (to User B) to application server 
  - Server stores the message to database and also sends the message to user B
